## **3. Scenario-Based & Coding Questions**
### **Scenario-Based Questions:**
- How would you design a fault-tolerant, event-driven system?
- How do you handle high traffic spikes in a microservices architecture?
- What strategies would you use to optimize slow database queries?
- How would you troubleshoot performance issues in a Spring Boot application?

### **Coding Questions (Based on Experience Level)**
#### **Beginner:**
1. Implement a Java program to find duplicates in an array.
2. Write a REST API in Spring Boot to fetch user details from a database.
3. Implement a basic producer-consumer problem using Java threads.

#### **Intermediate:**
1. Implement a microservice that communicates with another using Kafka.
2. Write a program to implement an LRU cache.
3. Develop a Spring Boot application with JWT authentication.

#### **Senior:**
1. Design a rate-limiting middleware for an API Gateway.
2. Optimize a NoSQL query fetching data from a large dataset.
3. Implement a distributed locking mechanism for a high-concurrency application.

## **4. Additional Resources & Learning Path**
- **Books:**
  - "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch
  - "Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz
  - "Spring in Action" by Craig Walls
- **Online Courses:**
  - Java & Spring Boot (Udemy, Coursera, Pluralsight)
  - System Design (Educative, Grokking System Design)
- **Hands-on Practice:**
  - Leetcode, CodeChef, Codeforces (for coding challenges)
  - Real-world projects (Open-source contributions, personal projects)

## **Conclusion**
This roadmap provides a structured guide for anyone preparing for Java Software Engineer roles, ranging from freshers to experienced developers. By following this plan, candidates can develop a strong foundation in Java development, microservices architecture, cloud technologies, and system design principles, ultimately increasing their chances of securing their desired role.
