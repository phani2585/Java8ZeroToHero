# Java Collections Framework - In-Depth Guide

## 📌 Introduction to Collections Framework
The **Java Collections Framework (JCF)** provides a standardized way to handle and manipulate groups of objects efficiently. It includes **interfaces**, **implementations (classes)**, and **algorithms** to handle different data structures in Java.

### 🔹 Key Features of Collections Framework:
✅ **Dynamic Sizing** – Unlike arrays, collections can grow and shrink dynamically.
✅ **Performance Optimization** – Provides optimized implementations for different use cases.
✅ **Thread Safety** – Supports concurrent collections for multi-threaded environments.
✅ **Built-in Algorithms** – Sorting, searching, and shuffling operations.

---

## 📌 Core Interfaces in Java Collections

| Interface  | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **List**   | Ordered collection allowing duplicates (ArrayList, LinkedList) |
| **Set**    | Unordered collection with unique elements (HashSet, TreeSet) |
| **Queue**  | FIFO-based collection (LinkedList, PriorityQueue) |
| **Deque**  | Double-ended queue (ArrayDeque, LinkedList) |
| **Map**    | Key-Value pairs (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap) |

---

## 📌 List Interface - Detailed Explanation & Code Examples

### 🔹 `ArrayList`
- **Dynamic Resizing:** Increases size dynamically.
- **Fast Random Access:** Uses an **array-based structure** (O(1) access time).

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.add("Cherry");
        
        System.out.println("ArrayList: " + list);
        System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + list.get(1));
    }
}
```

### 🔹 `LinkedList`
- **Doubly Linked List Implementation** – Faster insertions & deletions (O(1)).
- **Slower Random Access** – Needs traversal (O(n)).

```java
public class LinkedListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
        list.add("Dog");
        list.add("Cat");
        list.add("Horse");
        
        System.out.println("LinkedList: " + list);
        list.remove("Cat");
        System.out.println("After removal: " + list);
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 Set Interface - Unique Elements

### 🔹 `HashSet`
- **Unordered Collection** – No guarantees for order.
- **Uses Hashing** – Fast lookups (O(1) time complexity).

```java
public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add("Red");
        set.add("Blue");
        set.add("Green");
        set.add("Red"); // Duplicate ignored
        
        System.out.println("HashSet: " + set);
    }
}
```

### 🔹 `TreeSet`
- **Sorted Collection** – Uses a balanced BST (Red-Black Tree).
- **Maintains Order** – Elements are stored in ascending order.

```java
public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        treeSet.add(30);
        treeSet.add(10);
        treeSet.add(20);
        
        System.out.println("TreeSet: " + treeSet); // Output: [10, 20, 30]
    }
}
}
```

---

## 📌 Queue & Deque - FIFO & Double-ended Structures

### 🔹 `PriorityQueue`
- **Min Heap Implementation** – Elements sorted by priority.
- **Useful for Task Scheduling** & Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

```java
public class PriorityQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        pq.add(30);
        pq.add(10);
        pq.add(20);
        
        System.out.println("PriorityQueue: " + pq);
        System.out.println("Poll: " + pq.poll()); // Removes and returns the highest priority (smallest number)
    }
}
```

### 🔹 `ArrayDeque`
- **Fast insertions/removals from both ends** (O(1)).

```java
public class ArrayDequeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.addFirst("First");
        deque.addLast("Last");
        
        System.out.println("ArrayDeque: " + deque);
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 Map Interface - Key-Value Pairs

### 🔹 `HashMap`
- **Unordered Key-Value Storage** – Uses Hashing (O(1) lookup).

```java
public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(1, "One");
        map.put(2, "Two");
        map.put(3, "Three");
        
        System.out.println("HashMap: " + map);
    }
}
```

### 🔹 `LinkedHashMap`
- **Maintains Insertion Order**.

```java
public class LinkedHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> lmap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        lmap.put("A", 100);
        lmap.put("B", 200);
        lmap.put("C", 300);
        
        System.out.println("LinkedHashMap: " + lmap);
    }
}
```

### 🔹 `TreeMap`
- **Sorted Key-Value Storage** – Uses Red-Black Tree.

```java
public class TreeMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> tmap = new TreeMap<>();
        tmap.put(3, "Three");
        tmap.put(1, "One");
        tmap.put(2, "Two");
        
        System.out.println("TreeMap: " + tmap); // Output: {1=One, 2=Two, 3=Three}
    }
}
```

## 📌 When to Use Which Collection?

| Requirement | Best Collection |
|------------|----------------|
| Fast Random Access | `ArrayList` |
| Frequent Insert/Delete | `LinkedList` |
| Unique Elements (No Order) | `HashSet` |
| Unique Elements (Sorted) | `TreeSet` |

# Java HashMap - In-Depth Guide

## 📌 Introduction to HashMap

A **HashMap** is part of the **Java Collections Framework** and is used to store **key-value** pairs. It is implemented using a **hashing mechanism**, which provides **constant-time performance O(1)** for basic operations like `put()`, `get()`, and `remove()`, assuming a well-distributed hash function.

---

## 📌 How HashMap Works Internally?

### 🔹 Key Points:
✅ Stores elements in **buckets** (array of `Node<K, V>` objects).
✅ Uses **hashCode()** and **equals()** methods to locate keys.
✅ **Handles Collisions** using a **Linked List** (Java 7) or **Balanced Tree** (Java 8+).
✅ **Load Factor** and **Rehashing** for resizing the HashMap.
✅ **Performance:** Best case O(1), Worst case O(n) (due to collisions).

---

## 📌 Internal Structure of HashMap

```java
public class HashMap<K, V> {
    static class Node<K, V> {
        final int hash;
        final K key;
        V value;
        Node<K, V> next;

        Node(int hash, K key, V value, Node<K, V> next) {
            this.hash = hash;
            this.key = key;
            this.value = value;
            this.next = next;
        }
    }
    
    private Node<K, V>[] table; // Array of Nodes
    private int size;
    private final float loadFactor = 0.75f;
    
    public void put(K key, V value) {
        int hash = key.hashCode();
        int index = hash % table.length; // Determine bucket
        
        Node<K, V> newNode = new Node<>(hash, key, value, null);
        
        if (table[index] == null) {
            table[index] = newNode;
        } else {
            Node<K, V> current = table[index];
            while (current.next != null) {
                if (current.key.equals(key)) {
                    current.value = value; // Update existing key
                    return;
                }
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode; // Add to end of linked list (collision handling)
        }
        size++;
    }
    
    public V get(K key) {
        int hash = key.hashCode();
        int index = hash % table.length;
        Node<K, V> current = table[index];
        
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.key.equals(key)) {
                return current.value;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 Step-by-Step Working of `put()` and `get()`

### 🔹 Step 1: Compute Hash
- HashMap computes a **hash value** from the key using `hashCode()`.
- Java 8 optimizes this with **hash spreading** to minimize collisions.

```java
int hash = key.hashCode();
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Determine Index (Bucket Location)
- Index is calculated using:

```java
int index = hash % table.length;
```

### 🔹 Step 3: Handling Collisions
- If another entry exists at `index`, a **Linked List** or **Tree (Java 8)** is used.
- If size of linked list at a bucket **exceeds 8**, it converts to a **Tree (Red-Black Tree)** for faster lookups.

### 🔹 Step 4: Retrieving a Value
- HashMap checks the **hashCode()**, then uses `equals()` to find the exact key.

---

## 📌 HashMap Example Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        map.put(1, "One");
        map.put(2, "Two");
        map.put(3, "Three");
        map.put(2, "Updated Two"); // Updating existing key
        
        System.out.println("Value for key 2: " + map.get(2)); // Output: Updated Two
        
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " -> " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 HashMap Performance & Best Practices

| Concept | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Hashing** | Uses `hashCode()` to store elements efficiently. |
| **Load Factor** | Default is `0.75`. When exceeded, HashMap **doubles** in size. |
| **Initial Capacity** | Setting a proper size **avoids frequent rehashing**. |
| **Thread-Safety** | `ConcurrentHashMap` should be used for multi-threaded environments. |

---

## 🔥 Summary
✅ **HashMap uses an array of linked lists (or trees) to store key-value pairs.**
✅ **O(1) performance for well-distributed keys, O(n) for worst-case collisions.**
✅ **Java 8 optimizations (Tree-based structure for large buckets).**
✅ **Use `ConcurrentHashMap` in multi-threaded scenarios.**
